Sure! Let's go through examples using both the `interface` and `abstract` keywords to illustrate their usage and differences.

### **Using `interface` Keyword**

An `interface` in Java defines a contract that other classes can implement. It can contain method signatures (without implementation) and constants. Classes that implement an interface must provide implementations for all its methods.

Here’s an example of using the `interface` keyword:

```java
// Define an interface
interface Greeting {
    void greet(); // Method signature
}

// Implementing the interface
public class InterfaceExample implements Greeting {
    @Override
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from the interface implementation!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greeting greeting = new InterfaceExample();
        greeting.greet(); // Calls the implemented method
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Interface Definition**:
   - `Greeting` is an interface with a method signature `greet()`.

2. **Class Implementation**:
   - `InterfaceExample` implements the `Greeting` interface and provides the implementation for the `greet()` method.

3. **Usage**:
   - In the `main` method, an instance of `InterfaceExample` is created and assigned to a `Greeting` reference. The `greet()` method is called, which invokes the implementation provided in `InterfaceExample`.

### **Using `abstract` Keyword**

An `abstract` class can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). Subclasses must provide implementations for all abstract methods. Abstract classes can also have member variables, constructors, and static methods.

Here’s an example of using the `abstract` keyword:

```java
// Define an abstract class
abstract class Greeting {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    abstract void greet();

    // Concrete method
    void sayGoodbye() {
        System.out.println("Goodbye from the abstract class!");
    }
}

// Subclass implementing the abstract class
public class AbstractClassExample extends Greeting {
    @Override
    void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from the abstract class implementation!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greeting greeting = new AbstractClassExample();
        greeting.greet(); // Calls the implemented method
        greeting.sayGoodbye(); // Calls the concrete method
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Abstract Class Definition**:
   - `Greeting` is an abstract class with an abstract method `greet()` and a concrete method `sayGoodbye()`.

2. **Subclass Implementation**:
   - `AbstractClassExample` extends the `Greeting` abstract class and provides the implementation for the `greet()` method.

3. **Usage**:
   - In the `main` method, an instance of `AbstractClassExample` is created and assigned to a `Greeting` reference. Both the `greet()` method (implemented in the subclass) and `sayGoodbye()` method (inherited from the abstract class) are called.

### **Key Differences**

- **Interfaces**:
  - Define a contract with method signatures and constants.
  - Can be implemented by multiple classes.
  - Methods in an interface are public and abstract by default (prior to Java 8). From Java 8 onwards, interfaces can also have default and static methods with implementations.

- **Abstract Classes**:
  - Can contain both abstract and concrete methods.
  - Can have member variables, constructors, and other class members.
  - Used when you want to provide some common implementation or shared state across subclasses.
